# Personal-Website
This is the first website I built on my own, which is my personal website after completing the udemy course "The Result-Oriented Web Developer Course - BOOTCAMP 2022". There are some improvements that I could have made, and I will gradually implement them! 

For the frontend, I created this website with a combination of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5 and JavaScript. For the backend, I used a combination of node js and express js to create the REST API and AJAX requests, and used Mongodb as my database for this website.
